Overview {#jaxb-2-0-overview}
========

The Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) provides an API and tools
that automate the mapping between XML documents and Java objects.

The JAXB framework enables developers to perform the following
operations:

-   **Unmarshal** XML content into a Java representation

-   **Access** and **update** the Java representation

-   **Marshal** the Java representation of the XML content into XML
    content

JAXB gives Java developers an efficient and standard way of mapping
between XML and Java code. Java developers using JAXB are more
productive because they can write less code themselves and do not have
to be experts in XML. JAXB makes it easier for developers to extend
their applications with XML and Web Services technologies.
